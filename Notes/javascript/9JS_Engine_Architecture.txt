Js can run everywhere -> browser,server watch any device etc.
All this is possible because of 
JavaScript Runtime Environment(which has all the things req to run js code).
1) Js Engine
2)Apis
3)Callback queue
4)MicroTask queue
5)Eventloop
browser,Nodejs(These have Js Runtime Environment) 

------------JS ENGINE----------
It is not a machine.
It is a program.(in v8 chrome Engine it is built using c++)
How it works??

1) It takes our JavaScript Code (Human redable code)
      |      
2) Parsing (code is broken into tokens)
    syntax parser (generates)-> Abstract syntax tree(passed)->Compilation Phase
      | 
3) Compilation 
       -Interpreter(fast)(code is executed line by line without knowing next line)     
       -Compiler(Efficiency)(code is compiled first converted into optimized version and then executed) 
    JavaScript can behave has Interpreted Language as well as compiled Language it depends on js Engine.
(In Mondern browsers)Js Uses = Interpreter + Compiler

JIT Compilation = Interpreter + Compiler

In JIT Compilation while Interpreter goes line by line our compiler optimizes the next lines
so these both goes hand in hand. AOT ahead of time Compilation it takes a piece of code and tries to optimize it which is excuted in future
it also produces the byte code which goes to Execution phase.
4) Execution
Execution Phase:
Memory Heap(garbage collector free up space(Mark & Sweep algo)) 
+ 
CallStack

    Compiler does optimizations like
    1) In-lineing.
    2) Copy elision.
    3) Inline Caching.
