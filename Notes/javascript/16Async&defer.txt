Async and defer attributes used along with script tags
to load external scripts efficiently into web page.

When u load a web page there are two things happening.
1) HTML parsing
2) JS loading
        - fetching
        - executing


case 1 üëé

<script src="" />

Here broweser will start with HTML parsing it encounters script
it fetches and executes then and there and later continues html parsing.
Here HTML parsing is stopped until JS is fetched and executes.

case 2 üëç

<script async src="" />

Here broweser will start with HTML parsing it encounters script
it fetches script asynchronusly without stopping parsing and later while 
executing parsing is stopped and continues parsing after JS execution.
Here HTML parsing is stopped until JS is executes.

case 3 üíØ

<script defer src="" />

Here broweser will start with HTML parsing it encounters script
it fetches script asynchronusly without stopping parsing and scripts will 
be executed only after completing the HTML parsing.
No Stopping of HTML parsing.

Async attribute does not gurantee the order of execution of the scripts when there are multiple scripts.
but defer does follow order of scripts.

when u want to load independent scripts then use async else use defer.

Storage APIs follows same origin policy.
Origin:
1) Protocol - http/https
2) Host - flipkart.com/amazon.com
3) Port - 8080

when we say we are setting data for localstorage we are setting for these origin.
where can we aceess this data when origin is same.
