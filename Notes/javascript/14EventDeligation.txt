Event Deligation -> Technique of handling events in better way.
Event Deligation is based on event bubbling.

senario 1 üëç
You have a shopping site with diff catefories
laptops, cameras, shoes etc
for every div there is a event listner attached.
like - document.getElementById("laptop").addEventListner('click',()=>{})
but when u add event listners for camera shoes and manymore there will be many event listners.
So to Avoid this we should attach event listner to Parent instead of child.

But how will parent know which child EventListner is called??

example:

<div>
<ul id="category">
    <li id="laptops">laptops</li>
    <li id="cameras">cameras</li>
    <li id="shoes">shoes</li>
</ul>
</div>

document.querySelector("category").addEventListner('click',(e)=>{
    console.log(e.target.id);
    if(e.target.tagName=='LI')
    window.location.href="/"+e.target.id;
});

Since the events are bubbling up when ever you click on any child(li) it will to parent(ul)
and EventListner is added to parent so you can get the event from e obj and use it to decide which child is clicked.


senario 2 üëç (behaviour patterns)(this can be reuseable jst need to add data-uppercase to any child input to make it upper)
You have 3 input boxes and you need to add single event listner
if u enter anything in 1st input box u need to make in upper case.

<div id="form">
    <input id="name" data-uppercase></input>
    <input id="pan"></input>
    <input id="mobile"></input>
</div>

if u add this data-uppercase then it will be added to dataset inside e obj. 
document.querySelector("category").addEventListner('keyup',(e)=>{
    console.log(e.target.id);
    if(e.target.dataset.uppercase != undefined)
        e.target.value = e.target.value.toUpperCase();
});

Benfits:
Memory is saved(a lot of eventHandlers reduces to one in parent)
Writing less code
DOM manipulation(it is easy now if childs are increased)

disadvantages/limitations :-
1) All the events are not bubbled up
blur,
focus,
scroll,
resize because of few risks.

2) Event Deligation is not possible if stop propagation.
