Event Bubbling and capturing are two ways for Event propagation in DOM Tree.

Senario:-
-----------------------
div #grandparent -> onClickGrandParent()
-----------------
  div #praent    ->  onClickParent()
-------------
    div #child    -> onClickChild()

In Bubbling - Upward direction

If a child is clicked then onClickChild is called , onClickParent is called and onClickGrandParent is called in this order.
if praent is click then onClickParent,onClickGrandParent is called.


In capturing/Event trikkling  - DownWard direction

if u click grandparent then onClickGrandParent is called.
if u click parent then onClickGrandParent and onClickParent is called.
if u click child then onClickGrandParent,onClickParent & onClickChild is called.
How to Use???

document.getElementById("child").addEventListner('click',()=>{
},useCapture(true/false))

here useCapture decides to use Bubbling or capturing.
by default/false - Bubbling
true - capturing

if few of handlers have false and few have true;
Always First capturing happens then Bubbling happens.

grandparent - true //Capturing
praent - false //Bubbling
child - false //Bubbling

So when clicked child then all three are involved so for all three
first capturing is happend from top to bottom
grandparent will print first
then No capturing left so Bubbling start from bottom to up.
child will call second
parent is called last.

How to stop propgating events up the hirarcy or down the hirarcy??
- inside eventlistner we can use ((e)=>{ e.stopPropagation();})
if e.stopPropagation() is added to parent.
in case of Bubbling child , parent will be called but not grandparent since parent has stopped propagation going up.
in capturing child wont be printed when click on child because parent wont propagation down.
