1) function Statement:- 👍
function a(){
    console.log("hello");
}

2) function Expression 👍

Function acts as a value.

var b = function (){
    console.log("hello");
}

diff btw function Statement and function expression is Hoisting
function Statement is properly hoisted but in 
function expression it is a variable so it will store undefined.

3) function Declaration 👍

Function Statement is same as function Declaration

4) Anonymous functions 👍

function without a name. // function Statements req a name.

function (){} //Syntax error
Anonymous functions are used in a place where functions are used as values;

5) NAMED Function Expression 👍
Same as function expression but here function has a name
var b = function a(){
    console.log("asda");
}
 a(); //reference error(it is not a function in outer scope)(it is a variable(function))
 b(); - correct way

6) differece btw parameters & args? 👍
parameters = Identifiers(get those args are parameters), local variables in function scope
function a(param1,param2){
}

values that are passed inside the function are known as arguments.
a(1,2); //These are args

7) IMP******First class functions****** 👍

ABILITY TO USE FUNCTIONS AS VALUES ARE CALLED FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS.

functions can be stored,passed & returned to any functions.
First class functions - Ability to be used like values
first class citizens.

8) Arrow functions 👍
