Inheritance - one object trying to access methods of other objects

prototype -> when ever you create a object js automatically puts hidden properties into an object and attaches it to an object.
How to get access to all those funcitons??
Obj.__proto__ => you will find all functions
**this is attached to each and every method, object & variable etc
arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype
arr.__proto__ -> also has prototype
arr.__proto__.__proto__ === Object.prototype
arr.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ => null

When ever you create an array it has its prototype is Array.prototype has a prototype which is Object.prototype and its prototype is null.

arr => Array => Object => null
fun => Function => Object => null

How to access objects1 properties inside object2 ??
let object ={
    name: "sushrith",
    city: "Nizamabad",
    getIntro: function(){
        console.log(this.name+" from "+this.city);
    }
}

let object2 = {
    name : "ishh"
}

object2.__proto__ = object;
object2.name //ishh
object2.city //Nizamabad
object2.getIntro() // ishh from Nizamabad.

It will check main object and then in will go to proto if it doesnt find it will go to proto.proto and check.
