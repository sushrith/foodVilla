ployfill -> code which is replacement of old version of code ->converting your new version of code to old version inorder to work in olders version.
who converts this code? BABEL


console.logs are not directly removed by parcel you need a dependency

npm install -D babel-plugin-transform-remove-console 

when ever u have multiple children you should have keys for each child.
if there is no key used then reused components should be re-render again frm strt.

RENDER = Update something in the DOM(loading DOM into browser)

JSX = HTML Like syntax in javascript(const heading = <h1>Hello</h1>)
JSX is Not HTML inside JS
example HTML = <h1 tab-index="" class="root"></h1>
		JSX  = <h1 tabIndex="" className="root"></h1>
		
How does Js execute JSX?
Babel(js compiler) converts JSX into javascript(react.createElement("h1")) which converted to HTML.
JSX => React.CreateElement => Obj => HTML(DOM)
babel comes along with parcel

Functional component is a function which return JSX
to render functional component use <Heading/>

to use react component use {} and u can write any js code here {}

const ReactElement = React.createElement("h1",{},"hello");
const functionalComponent = () => {return <h1>hello</h1>}

U can call functionalComponent as <Heading/> OR {Heading()} [because its a function]

JSX cannot causes any XXS attack
because JSX sanitizes everything before execute.

Component Composition => component inside a component
