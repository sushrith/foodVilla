where do u need to call the api??
if u call api anywhere it will call api whenever it is rendered
call api in useEffect. It is called only the first time when component rendered.
You can pass second arg in useEffect so that it will call only when that state is updated.
dependency array -> useEffect 2nd arg
when empty array passed useEffect will be called once after initial render.
if pass a state in dependency array when state update render+useEffect will be called.

Shimmer UI resembles the pages actual UI.used for loading.

=> In Jsx
(Expression produces value and Statement performs action)
Any js Expression work not js Statement

Statement => {
   a=10;
   console.log() 
}

Expression(Single line without ;) => {console.log()}

Expression => {(a=10),console.log(a)}

Expression {a>b?"a":"b"}

Statement{if(a>b){
   return "a";
}else{
   return "b";
}
}
