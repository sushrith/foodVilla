React.Fragment => Component exported by react <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> or <></> (use it instead of div and having single parent)

Jsx can have only parent

Config Driven UI => UI is driven by config sent by backend(API) to make it dynamic.

Optional chainging ?

map vs foreach?

React uses virtual dom to be faster
we have DOM and Virtual DOM(Representation of DOM)
There is a Reconciliation algorithm which finds diff btw trees
and update only that part of tree it will not render whole tree when update
If there is change in a component then rerender only that compontent and children not whole thing.

if a component has 4 children| during update new child was introduced
1   2    3   4   			 | 5 	1 	2	3 	4
Then react dont know which child was new so it will render all childs.
But it u use key(unique) for each child then react can identify which has been introduced then only that child will be rendered it will be sooo fast.

Imp-> When ever state updates virtualdom will be updated
diff algorithm will compare current and previuos virtualdom
and update the diffrenece in actual dom which will be shown in UI
Thats why react is faster. [FAST DOM MANIPULATION]

In React 16 diff algorithm changed and introduced react fiber new reconciliation engine responsible for diff

why dont we use index as key??
never use index as key
No key << index key <<<<<<< Unique key(best practise)
