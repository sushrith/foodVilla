Synthetic events??

using default u can only export one component
//default import
when u use default no need of curly braces while import
//named default
when u dont use default u can export many components

* React uses one way data binding
Two way data binding is sometimes become unpredictable.
two way data binding not good for optimization.
In the input box u put a value and from input u cannot change
that value while typing u need to update that value then only it will 
be reflected (use onchange to update the value)

* React cannot keep track of local variables. when local variable is updated
diff algo wont work and UI wont be updated thats why we need
state variables.

* Every component in react maintains a state
every time u need local variable u use state
use useState Hook from react.

* Hooks is just a js function they give us functionalities
useState => create State variables which are local (returns an array)
when update state and use the state at same time it is called 2 way binding 

when u have local variables why do u need state variables??
->when u update a local variable value will be updated but not DOM.
->But when u update state variable DOM will be rerendered
->To make varibales to be in Sync in UI we need state variables
