How to create your own react app ->

To make js app production ready:

1) Bundlers -> webpack,vite(fast),parcel are bundlers
in create-react-app uses webpack,babel

Lets use parcel in app
npm is used to manage packages - node-package-manager(NPM is Maven for UI)
-> npm init =>[You will get package.json] Initialize NPM -y(to skip ques)

-> npm install -D parcel (-D - dev dependency it means u need this parcel in development env because it should not be in prod)

-> After this command we will get package-lock.json , Nodemodules (
It will lock the version , never put in gitignore
This will tell u what exact version are you using in production.
It maintains Hash of version also(Integrity)
if u define version as ^2.0.2 in package.json
it will auto upgrade if there are any example 2.0.3
then in package-lock.json it will be written as 2.0.3
It has sufficient info to create node-modules
) (node-modules is like database for packages, add it to gitignore)

-> ^caret(auto up for minor version) & ~tilde(auto up for major version) 

->parcel uses many things to optimize like
minifier(to minify the code)

-> Install React and ReactDOM (npm install react)

->npx parcel index.html(npx - execute using npm, parcel - bundler,index.html - entry point)
[This will start a server]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Now in js file import React and ReactDOM
-> when browser parses index.html it wont understand import so u need to define that js file is a module.
    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>

HOT MODULE RELOAD (HMR) it is done by parcel since it keep track of all files(file watcher algos - written in c++)(Ctrl+S then reload app)  	
-> Parcel will autorefresh pages after changes.

-> U will also have folder .ParcelCache(uses this space for minify a)

-> dist folder(development build[minified version off app and deploy to our server])
TO create production build we uses
npx parcel build index.html(Minify the app/build in dist folder)
[It will minify and create 3 files 1)index.html 2)index.*****.css 3)index.*****.js]

--------Bundlers(Parcel) will provide all these which are required for building production react apps ----------All these are packages and parcel is orchestrating them--------Every dependency has other dependency(which is transtive dependency)-----------


1) HMR - hot module Replacement , 
2) File watcher algos in c++
3) Live Server
4) BUNDLING (combining our all code into 3 files html,css,js)
5) Minify (In prod builds) (import short versions of react and react dom)
6) Cleaning our code (No console logs)
7) Dev and Production Build
8) Super fast build algos 
9) Image Optimization (minify images also)
10) Caching while development (as u see subsequent builds are faster because of caching)(.ParcelCache folder KEEP IN GITIGNORE)
11) Compatable with older version of browser (browserList package-u can include in package.json)
12) HTTPS on dev (npx parcel index.html --https)
13) Uses Consistent Hashing algos 
14) Parcel is zero config bundler
15) Tree Shaking - Removing unwanted code

In production build it takes 1.5 sec
In dev build it takes 400ms, In subseq builds it take 5ms

React is fast because of Bundlers(Parcel),Vitrual DOM etc etc
